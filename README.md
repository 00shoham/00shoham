My name is Idan Shoham.  I live in Canada.

I used to be the CTO of an IAM company.  After a successful "exit" I've become more of a
hobbyist.  One of my hobbies is writing code, usually to automate things in my own life.

Here you will find projects for home automation, security video and whatever else comes
up.  It's mostly written in C, because (a) that's performant and (b) I find it fun to
write in C.

Feel free to contribute or contact me.
